/*
Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items: health potions, torches, 
and arrows. Create an enum to identify the different types of items, and an std::array to store the 
number of each item the player is carrying (The enumerators are used as indexes of the array). 
The player should start with 2 health potions, 5 torches, and 10 arrows. Write a function called countTotalItems() 
that returns how many items the player has in total. Have your main() function print the output of countTotalItems() 
as well as the number of torches.

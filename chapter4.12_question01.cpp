/*
Write a program that asks the user to enter their full name and their age. As output, tell the user how many years theyâ€™ve 
lived for each letter in their name (for simplicity, count spaces as a letter).
Sample output:

Enter your full name: John Doe
Enter your age: 46
You've lived 5.75 years for each letter in your name.
